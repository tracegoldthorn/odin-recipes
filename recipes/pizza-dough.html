        <ul>
            <li>50g Flour</li>
            <li>390g Flour</li>

            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>

            <li>In the bowl of a mixer, mix for 3 minutes. Mix in remaining flour (dough should be only slightly sticky).</li>
            <li>After adding the flour, continue to mix for 5 minutes.</li>

            <li>Add toppings of your choice and place in a preheated 450 degrees Fahrenheit oven for 8-10 minutes, or until crust is golden brown. Cool 2-3 minutes before cutting or serving.</li>
